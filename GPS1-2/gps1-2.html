  <p>What is pair programming?</p>
  <p>Pair programming is a way to collaborate on coding problems. It's
  beneficial as a learning tool as well as a teaching tool. In pair
  programming there is a driver and navigator. They can both
  contribute to solving a problem.
  </p>
  <p>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</p>
  <p>One of the barriers to working on a team is different personality
  types. Pair programming will help us relate to our different
  personalities better. It is also helpful to have two pairs of
  eyes checking the code to catch for mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>Compare Driver and Navigator</p>
  <p>The driver usually is the programmer who implements the code, and
  is the person sitting at the computer typing. The navigator usually
  serves as the guide and checks syntax and looks at the broader
  overview.

  <p>Reflection Comment</p>

  Reflect on your learning. How was it to pair this time? Did you feel more comfortable? How did you do with the learning competencies? Add your reflection as a comment in your gps1-2.html file.

  <p> I felt much more comfortable pairing this time than GPS1-1.  I felt I didn't have to struggle so much reading directions and then coding simultaneously.  I realize that GPS is a method to give us feedback to advise us whether or not we are on track for success at DBC.</p>

  <p> I felt more comfortable choosing and placing the appropriate HTML tags on the document.  We did not have much time to compare the different HTML tags to one another, but I do feel comfortable about what these tags are and what they do.  I feel comfortable choosing appropriate tags.  I felt talking about pair-programming more solidified my opinion that pair-programming is a good learning tool.  Teaching someone and guiding them, also working together and collaborating,  and struggling through a problem together is beneficial to both programmers.</p>
