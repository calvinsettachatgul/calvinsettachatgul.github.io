  <p>What is pair programming?</p>
  <p>Pair programming is a way to collaborate on coding problems. It's
  beneficial as a learning tool as well as a teaching tool. In pair
  programming there is a driver and navigator. They can both
  contribute to solving a problem.
  </p>
  <p>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</p>
  <p>One of the barriers to working on a team is different personality
  types. Pair programming will help us relate to our different
  personalities better. It is also helpful to have two pairs of
  eyes checking the code to catch for mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>Compare Driver and Navigator</p>
  <p>The driver usually is the programmer who implements the code, and
  is the person sitting at the computer typing. The navigator usually
  serves as the guide and checks syntax and looks at the broader
  overview.
