#U1.W3: GPS 1.2: Pairing Website

**DO NOT LOOK AT THIS CHALLENGE UNTIL YOUR GUIDED PAIRING SESSION!!**

## Learning Competencies
  - Use HTML tags to place content on a website
  - Apply CSS to position elements on an HTML page
  - Compare different HTML tags to one another
  - Examine pair-programming concepts

## Summary
This GPS is designed to help you examine pair programming and the roles of driver and navigator. Your goal is to design and build a single-page website that introduces the concept of pair programming!

**Don't forget to check in!**

## Release 0: Wireframe the site
Discuss how you want the page to look. Draw a wireframe or use a wireframing tool with your pair. It doesn't have to be perfect, but get a rough idea of how you want the site to look.

If you want to use a collaborative drawing site, you can use [Precursor](https://prcrsr.com/) or [flockdraw](http://flockdraw.com) (It's like a collaborative version of MSPaint). You don't need an account, and you can invite people by sharing the URL. You can also use any other wireframing tool and share your screen. (Or use a pen and paper and share)

You'll need sections for:
- Title
- Your names
- What is pair programming?
- Why is pair programming important to DBC?
- Compare Driver and Navigator
- Anything else you want!

## Release 1: HTML

Open a stypi file (only one person needs to do this) and name it with a `.html` extension (You will be able to see it in stypi by either hovering or clicking on the "eye" in the top right of the navigation bar). Share the URL with your pair and guide.

Based on your wireframe, add a skeleton for each section.

Be sure to include a link to the phase-0-unit-1/week-3/9-gps1-2/gps1-2.css stylesheet in your html! It won't work now, but you will be thankful later when you are copying and pasting the html and css into the separate files.

## Release 2: Discuss Pair Programming
Discuss the following topics, and add content for each section in the skeleton. Time-box this section to about 10 minutes or so.

- What is pair programming?
- Why is pair programming important to DBC?
- Compare Driver and Navigator

## Release 3: Dress it up!
Use CSS to make it look nice. Include pictures, outside fonts, etc. You will need to add CSS inside the `<style>` tags because stypi won't accept an actual link to an external stylesheet. This isn't good practice though. Why do you think it's not good practice?

## Release 4: Reflect

Reflect on your learning. How was it to pair this time? Did you feel more comfortable? How did you do with the learning competencies? Add your reflection as a comment in your gps1-2.html file.

## Release 5: Copy, commit, and push
When you are finished, copy your code into the [gps1-2.css](gps1-2.css) and [gps1-2.html](gps1-2.html) files. Make sure your css from the `<style>` section is in the CSS file and remove it from the HTML section. Update the html file. Then, test that everything is still  working by saving them and running them together from your computer.

Commit and push your changes onto the phase-0-unit-1 repository.

## Release 6: Publish
Using the terminal, practice copying the html and css sheets into a new folder in your [USERNAME].github.io site. Commit and push your changes to your github.io site. Double check that everything is displaying properly. Then add a link on the index of your site to make sure people can find it!

## Release 7: Give Feedback
Don't forget to give [feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new) to your pair!
