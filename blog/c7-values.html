    <h2>Values</h2>
    <p>Honesty 4</p>
    <p>Efficiency 4</p>
    <p>Intellectual status 3</p>
    <p>Knowledge 4</p>
    <p>Persistence 4</p>
    <p>Responsibility 4</p>
    <p>Self-knowledge  4</p>
    <p>Will-power 4</p>
    <p>Self-reliance 4</p>
    <p>Personal development 4</p>

    <p>I believe Intellectual status is something I value because I am actually insecure in my own intellect and need some validation of it.  I don't think it is because I have an ego, although it is closely related.  I believe I try to build my skills and show my ability to solve problems to be appreciated and build my intellectual status.</p>
    <p>Recently someone in my cohort group asked me to look at a test he/she could not figure out.  I discovered the fault in the individual's code and felt proud that I could help her.  It feeded into my ego somewhat, but it also felt good I learned something and helped someone.</p>
    <p>I think recognizing what I value will help me mediate stereo-type threat because when I feel under attack because of stero-types about me or anxious about proving something I will Identify that anxiety and emotion stems from what I value strongly. </p>
    <p>Other exercises I feel will be helpful to mediate stere-type threat are just to tell myself that being diverse is really a groups strength.  I believe different perspectives is key to a groups ability to be creative and solve problems in the best way.</p>
