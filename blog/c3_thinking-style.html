     <h2>Abstract Sequential</h2>

    <p>My thinking style is predominantly Abstract Sequential, and I have researched 2 sources to determine the qualities of this class of learner</p>

    <p>I have listed the characteristics I found below at the bottom of this page:</p>

    <p>I really hope the characteristics I identify in myself and that are  qualities that are characteristic of Abstract thinkers can help me learn and develop at DBC.</p>

    <p>I really feel like I have to make the best effort to understand a problem before attempting to solve it.  I analyze problems before implementing a solution, and I am deliberate when solving the problem.</p>

    <h2>Current Struggles at DBC P0</h2>
    <p>
      One aspect of the learning I have done so far that I am struggling with is making choices that require creative choices such as color and layout and content.  I feel like I have to build a knowledge base about what looks good and what content I need to include before implementing any code to build my website.  I feel this is related to me over analyzing and not wanting to make a mistake that will make my website not look very good.
    </p>

    <h2>Fixed vs Growth Mindset</h2>

    <p>So how does this relate to a Growth Mindset and how can I grow from knowing how I learn and think?  Well, the growth mindset says we are not fixed but can change the way we think and behave.  We can take the feedback we are getting from how we are struggling to learn and knowledge about ourselves to change our thinking style to learn in more efficient ways.</p>

    <p>Is there a way I can have or appreciate the qualities of being a random abstract thinker?  There are many qualities I would consider beneficial to me at DBC that an abstract random thinker would have.</p>

    <p>I think it would help to just brainstorm and express myself rather than analyze first and then express myself.  This exercise will take some practice, but really these are exercises we all did while in English Class in elementary school.</p>

    <p>Is there a way I can think without writing down steps and a procedure to accomplish my goal?  I feel like I rely too much on a traditional established methodology.  Many times being creative is not about a procedure, it's about looking at emotions and feelings.  Is there a way to better deal with open ended problems that require some choices to be made about how to express myself?</p>

    <p>Maybe part of being more of an abstract thinker is to engage in the actions an abstract thinker would take.  This may mean getting feedback and communicating with others often.</p>

    <h2>What exercises can I do to make me realize the qualities that are not tied to Abstract Sequential?</h2>

    <!--<p>I have found a source that lists some stretches for the Abstract Sequential thinker:</p>-->

    <p>
      This learner likes:<br>
      §         his/her point to be heard<br>
      §         analyzing situations before making a decision or acting<br>
      §         applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems<br>
      They learn best when:<br>
      §        they have access to experts or references<br>
      §        placed in stimulating environments<br>
      §        able to work alone<br>
      What's hard for them?<br>
      §        Being forced to work with those of differing views<br>
      §        Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly<br>
      §        Repeating the same tasks over and over<br>
      §        Lots of specific rules and regulations<br>
      §        "sentimental" thinking<br>
      §        Expressing their emotions<br>
      §        Being diplomatic when convincing others<br>
      §        Not monopolizing a conversation<br>
