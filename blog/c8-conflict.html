<h1>Conflict</h1>
    <p>We've all had experience with conflict and many times it has left us feeling angry or upset.  What if you could analyze the way you are feeling on a more detailed level?  This can be helpful to mediate negative feelings and resolve the conflict.  Ultimately, I can see this helping me be just a better person.</p>
    <h2>An Example of Conflict I Experienced</h2>
    <p>A time I had conflict was when I was employee.  A supervisor had asked me to perform a task and I felt agitated and upset because the supervisor did not know the process involved in completing the task.  The supervisor assumed it was a simple task that could be completed only in a relatively short time or without effort.</p>
    <h2>My feelings</h2>
    <p>I felt taken for granted in this case because the supervisor asked for my help but there was a disconnect between my knowledge of the process and how the supervisor understood what the task entailed.  Really the task should not have been dismissed as trivial.  There was no reason for the supervisor to feel this way because he in fact did not know what I had to do to complete the task.</p>
    <h2>Actions Taken</h2>
    <p>My first reaction was definitely feeling resentful.  I shut down communication and took myself away from interacting with the supervisor at first.  I then tried to make the supervisor understand what I had to do and argue about the complexity of the task.  I felt he was also getting upset because I was being critical of how he understood the task and process.  I felt like I could have been more calm and handled the situation differently.  His expression of anger could have been mediated by my calm reasoning.</p>
    <h2>How to Mitigate the conflict</h2>
    <p>I definitely feel if I had reasoned about the why the supervisor did not know the process and calmly explain the process to him I could have handled the situation differently. I would not be as agitated and the supervisor would not be displeased.  If he had expressed disagreement I would have had to just let him understand on another occasion or in a different way.  </p>

    <p>  In this case there was a true disconnect  the supervisor did not have adequate input in the process and had little true knowledge of the process.  Because of this, there was truly difficulties in him understanding my situation, but really there is no reason to be upset about it, only to acknowledge that he may disagree that he doesn't know what the process and to move on.</p>
