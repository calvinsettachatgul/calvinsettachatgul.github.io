    <h2>Blocs, Procs, Lambdas</h2>

    <p></p>

    <h2>Blocs</h2>
    <p>Ruby blocks are passed to iterator methods such as each.  The method call is a syntax which accepts a block.  Methods such as each accepting this block is considered to be a syntax type of coding rather than the method getting passed in as an argument because the block is not an argument or an object.</p>
    <h2>Procs</h2>
    <p>What if we wanted to actually name a chunk of code as an object and assign it to a variable so we could pass it to a method as an argument?  Then we would use a ruby Proc.  An object instantiated from the class Proc is a ruby object which represents a chunk of code.  The object can be assigned to a variable and passed to a method as an argument.</p>
    <h2>Lambdas</h2>
    <p>Lambdas are a variation on the Proc object, but has several differences in characteristics. Lambdas are also chunks of code, but Lambdas require explicit creation and can't be called by &block, with the & sign.  lambdas return to the code block in which they are defined, therefore a return expression inside the method code in which they defined will also occur.  A Proc on the other hand will return a value for the code block in which the method is defined.  If the return value of the Proc takes place then other return expressions of the method will not execute.</p>
    <p>The final differences is that lambdas will not execute and raise an argument if it does not get passed the correct number of arguments.  A proc will run with arguments defaulted to nil if not specified the correct number of arguments.</p>
