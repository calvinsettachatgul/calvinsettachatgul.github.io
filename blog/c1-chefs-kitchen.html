      So far my take on the DBC eperience has been pretty smooth and problem free.  I did prepare on my own a little bit before starting phase 0. What I anticipate is a very difficult, but inspired change in me, and I hope this is realized.  I will try my best to do whatever it takes for this to happen on my part.  I already have been inspired to become a programmer.  I have created tools that were programming oriented that I felt very driven to create and make better.  I look to a career in programming to foster this feeling even in my daily life, in the hopes that I will build and be a great contributor to some common good, as well as my own interests.
If DBC can give capture that feeling allow others to feel that way, I believe that this is a great goal. I am definitely excited for this to happen.

        There are several aspects of DBC that I find beneficial.  I like the aspect of working together to learn from each other.  I have always been team orriented but I understand there is some benefit to struggling with material individually as well.

        I really hope I can engage and contribute to my cohort to not dissappoint them and give the the best learning experience that they deserve as well.
    </p>

      <p>What has made me nervous is falling behind in the material because it is so fast paced and not being able to contribute, or even being asked to leave.  I am also nervous about opening up and expressing my inabilities and asking for help.  But, I know these are all necessary for my success at DBC and even career and life.
