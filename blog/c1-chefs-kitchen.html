      So far my take on the DBC experience has been pretty smooth and problem free.  I did prepare on my own a little bit before starting phase 0. What I anticipate is a very difficult and inspired change in me, and I hope this is realized.  I will try my best to do whatever it takes for this to happen on my part.  I already have been inspired to become a programmer.  I have created tools that were programming orriented that I felt very driven to create and make better.  I look to a career in programming to foster this feeling, even in my daily life.  I hope that I will build things and be a great contributor to some common good, as well as my own interests.
If DBC can capture that feeling and  help others to feel that way, I believe that this is a great goal. I am definitely excited for this to happen.

        There are several aspects of DBC that I find beneficial.  One aspect I like the aspect of working together to learn from each other.  I have always been team orriented, but I understand there is some benefit to struggling with material individually as well and strecthing yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        I really hope I can engage and contribute to my cohorts education to not dissappoint them. I'd like to give the the best learning experience that they deserve as well.
    </p>

      <p>What has made me nervous is falling behind in the material because it is so fast paced and not being able to contribute, or even being asked to leave.  I am also nervous about opening up and expressing my inabilities and asking for help.  But, I know these are all necessary for my success at DBC and even career and life.
