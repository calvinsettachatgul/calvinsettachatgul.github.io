    <p>There are 3 important ways to specify the position attributes value.  Each of the 3 values of relative, absolute, and fixed enable features of an html document to behave differently on an html document.</p>
    <p>Relative</p>
    <p>Relative positioning means it is repositioned relative to where it would have been if no positioning attributes were given to the element.  For example an html element positioned at coordinates x and y may not be given additional positioning attributes such as top, left, bottom or right.  The position will still remain at coordinates x and y on the page.  If positioning attributes are given to this feature such as top 10px.  The 10px would shift the item 10px down from the y coordinate, not from the top of the html page.  The shift occurs relative to the former x and y coordinates.</p>
    <p>Absolute</p>

    <p>Fixed</p>
