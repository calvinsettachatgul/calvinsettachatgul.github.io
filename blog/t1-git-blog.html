    <h2>Benefits of Git Version Control and Github
    Learn How to Be a Web Dev

    <p>
      Version control is important for project success.  During the lifetime of the project files and code will change.  It is important to know and keep track of which versions work and fail.  A primary purpose of version control is a method to roll back the project to a version that works when the project is broken.  Version control serves as a safeguard against a broken project in this way.
      A second purpose of version control is to provide a means to develop a project in different directions.  The project may change its intended course and evolve over the lifetime of the project.  Therefore it is helpful to foster this development in an organized way.
      The third purpose builds off the second of branching with different collaborators.  Collaboration is much more organized with version control.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git works locally on your computer to allow you version control.  Git provides for commits or snapshots of your project whenever you want to make a change or bundle several changes together.  These commits are versions of your project.  You can roll back or discard changes or branch off a main branch of your project and develop your project in another direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        GitHub combines version control with an environment to collaborate with others remotely.
        Storing code on GitHub allows you to share the code with other developers.
        This social coding allows for making the code open source.  You can find help from other developers and incorporate their ideas and improvements.
